This app is based on tkinter and Pillow modules of python for basic operations on images like **sharpening**, **blurring, converting to BnW, reducing colour and reducing brightness.**

Open the BasicEdit file in dist folder:

1. Simply open the image to be modified.

2. Select one or more options of edit.

Modified files are saved in your folder.(*Vollah!*)

(Each modification creates a new file, not all edits are mereged into one file.)
