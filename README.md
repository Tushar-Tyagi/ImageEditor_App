# ImageEditor_App
This app is based on tkinter and Pillow modules of python for basic operations on images like sharpening, blurring, converting to BnW, reducing colour and reducing brightness.

Simply open the image to be modified.

Select one or more options of edit.

(Each modification creates a new file, not all edits are mereged into one file.)
